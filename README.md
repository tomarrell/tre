# Tré
A simple, fast and interactive alternative to 'tree.' 

Tre doesn't aim for feature parity with tree necessarily, but aims to provide useful functionality on top of standard tree to speed up command-line file and directory navigation.

## Features 
- Ignores hidden directories by default
- Parses .gitignore and ignores matching files/dirs
- Colorized output, easier to distinguish node types
- 25% shorted command than `tree`!

# Installation
Currently installation is only from source.
